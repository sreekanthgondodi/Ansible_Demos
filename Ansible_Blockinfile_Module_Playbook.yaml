# *******************************************  Scenario: Ansible Blockinfile Module *********************************************************

# The Nautilus DevOps team wants to install and set up a simple httpd web server on all app servers in Stratos DC. Additionally, they want to deploy a sample web page for now using Ansible only. Therefore, write the required playbook to complete this task. Find more details about the task below.

# We already have an inventory file under /home/thor/ansible directory on jump host. Create a playbook.yml under /home/thor/ansible directory on jump host itself.

# Using the playbook, install httpd web server on all app servers. Additionally, make sure its service should up and running.

# Using blockinfile Ansible module add some content in /var/www/html/index.html file. Below is the content:

# Welcome to XfusionCorp!

# This is Nautilus sample file, created using Ansible!

# Please do not modify this file manually!

# The /var/www/html/index.html file's user and group owner should be apache on all app servers.

# The /var/www/html/index.html file's permissions should be 0655 on all app servers.

# Note:

# i. Validation will try to run the playbook using command ansible-playbook -i inventory playbook.yml so please make sure the playbook works this way without passing any extra arguments.

# ii. Do not use any custom or empty marker for blockinfile module.

# -------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
# Solution:

# 1. At first ansible inventory file is working properly and doesn't have any file exist from jump server to all the app server's 
# ansible all -a '/var/www/html/' -i inventory

# 2. Create playbook based on the specifications

- name: block-in-file sample playbook
  hosts: all
  become: true
  gather_facts: yes
  tasks:
  - name: Install apache packages 
    yum:
      name: httpd
      state: present
  - name: ensure httpd is running
    service:
      name: httpd 
      state: started
  - name: generate index file in all app servers 
    blockinfile:
      path: /var/www/html/index.html
	  create: yes
	  group: apache
	  owner: apache
	  mode: 0655
      block: |

# 3.  Post file saved , run below command to execute the playbook 
# ansible-playbook -i inventory playbook.yml --syntax-check
# ansible-playbook -i inventory playbook.yml --check
# ansible-playbook -i inventory playbook.yml

# 4.  Validate the task by below command 
# ansible all -a 'ls -lrt /var/www/html/' -i inventory
# ansible all -a 'curl http://localhost/' -i inventory
