# ****************************************** Scenario: Ansible Ping Module Usage *************************************************

# The Nautilus DevOps team is planning to test several Ansible playbooks on different app servers in Stratos DC. Before that, some pre-requisites must be met. Essentially, the team needs to set up a password-less SSH connection between Ansible controller and Ansible managed nodes. One of the tickets is assigned to you; please complete the task as per details mentioned below:

# a. Jump host is our Ansible controller, and we are going to run Ansible playbooks through thor user on jump host.

# b.Make appropriate changes on jump host so that user thor on jump host can SSH into App Server 1 through its respective sudo user. (for example tony for app server 1).

# c. There is an inventory file /home/thor/ansible/inventory on jump host. Using that inventory file test Ansible ping from jump host to App Server 1, make sure ping works.

# ------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
# Solution:

1. At first ansible inventory file is working properly and doesn't have any file exist from jump server to all the app server's 
ansible all -m ping -i inventory

2. Create ssh keys to exchange with app servsers
ssh-keygen -t rsa

3. Copy public key to app servers
ssh-copy-id -i ~/.ssh/id_rsa.pub tony@stapp01

4. Verify the ping connectivity
ansible all -m ping -i inventory
